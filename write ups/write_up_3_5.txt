I am making a website for a club that I am in, Pitt Kindness Cookies. Originally I made it a single page with a 
menu at the top that had links to jump down to that section further down on the page. I decided I wanted buttons
instead so I made a new website utilizing framesets. My page has three frames, ( rows of 30%, 5%, and 65%).
The first frame (30% of the window) has a logo that I designed on GIMP. I used a cookie cartoon from thenounproject.com 
and two fonts from dafont.com. The sources for these are all listed in my assets.md.
The second frame (5% of the window) has a menu. There are several links for the pages I am including in my website:
About Us, Cookie Drop Dates, Get Involved, Mental Health Resources, and Contact Us. When you click these links,
the page it links to appears in the third window (45%). When the website opens, the default page displayed to 
the third frame is about-us.html. 
Somethings that still need worked on are the general asthetics of the website. The background is currently pretty bland
and the menu needs spaced out. I might change the links to buttons to give a better look. If i stick with links, they need 
spaced out better and I would like to change the colors and make it so the color does not chnage after its been pressed.
The fonts on the webpage are pretty basic and still in the normal black color. I would like to make them more pleasing 
to the eye.
I also need to add much of the actual content to the page. This will include writing up a page about the details of the club
and what we do, researching and linking to the mental health resources on and off campus. I also want to look up how to 
make a link to email to a specefic email account - that I still need to make. I did it once in my ENGR 15 class and think it 
would be a nice touch to my website.
