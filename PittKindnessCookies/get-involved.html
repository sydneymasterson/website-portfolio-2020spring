    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    <p>Want to get involved? Great! There are several ways to help out:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Join Us</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Members of Kindness Cookies take bags to club meetings to be decorated,
            bag cookies for drops, and hand out cookies during drops. Members may
            also participate in other activities and fundraisers that come up
            throughout the year. Interested in becoming a member? <a href='contact-us.html' target = 'displayArea'>Reach out!</a></li>
        </ul>
      <li>Decorate Bags</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Are you part of a club or organization at Pitt? Every month we rely on
            groups like yours to decorate cookie bags with kind and supportive messages.
            This is a great way to make a positive impact on campus as well as get
            service hours! If you and your organization would like to decorate cookie bags,
            <a href='contact-us.html' target = 'displayArea'>send us a message</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Donate</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Unfortunately, the AFSP Campus Walk at Duquense has been cancelled, so
            Pitt Kindness Cookies will no longer be participating. This is still a
            great cause and you can donate <a target = "_blank" href = "https://afsp.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&eventID=6653">here</a>.</li>
