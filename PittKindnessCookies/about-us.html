    <p>Pitt Kindness Cookies is an unafiliated organization focused on
      bringing awareness to mental health on campus. By handing out cookies, we
      hope to not only brighten students' day but also start a conversation about
      mental well-being. Our main goal is to destigmatize the topic and give students
      the confidence to reach out to a friend or ask for help.</p>

    <p>Our club was founded seven years ago by University of Pittsburgh freshman.
      Unbeknownst to him, his roommate was seriously struggling with mental health
      and tragically took his own life. Wishing he would have known about his roommate's
      struggle, the student started Kindness Cookies to help bring awareness to the issue
      and get people talking about mental health.</p>

    <p>This now Pitt graduate still funds the club today, providing 200 Insomnia Cookies'
      chocolate chip cookies for us to hand out at Hillman Library every month. We rely
      on other clubs or organizations to decorate the cookie bags with kind and supportive
      messages to help bring smiles to the students' faces.</p>
